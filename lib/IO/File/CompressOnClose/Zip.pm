=head1 DESCRIPTION

IO::File::CompressOnClose::Zip is a subclass of IO::File::CompressOnClose
that creates a zip archive containing a file when that file is closed.

By default, the archive will be named after the source file with the suffix
'.zip'. The archive will contain a single file named after the basename of
the source file.  The name that the file inside the archive is given may be
overriden with the C<< ->member_filename() >> accessor.

=head1 ACCESSORS

In addition to the accessors provided by IO::File::CompressOnClose, an
IO::File::CompressOnClose::Zip object has several get/set accessor methods.
When used to set an attribute, the accessors return the previous value of
the attribute.

=head2 member_filename()

The name that the file in the archive will be given. By default, this is the
basename of the source filename.
